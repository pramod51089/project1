usage: apk update

Description:
  apk update forces updating of the indexes from all configured package
  repositories. This command is not needed in normal operation as all applets
  requiring indexes will automatically refresh them after caching time
  expires.
The command '/bin/sh -c apk update -y     && apk add --no-cache tar     && apk upgrade COPY docker/nrflex/mysql-database-config.yml /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/mysql-database-config.yml' returned a non-zero code: 1
